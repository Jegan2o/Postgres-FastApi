1. Write a program for user registration in fastAPI ( Using postgreSQL )

a. Registration fields – Full Name,Email,Password,Phone,Profile_picture
b. Create table Users  to store :  First Name,Password,Email,Phone
c. Create table Profile to store  : Profile_picture
d. Check Email , Phone already exist

2.  GET method – get registered user details

Hint : Unique user_id, Connect two tables (Users and Profile) using user_id as foreign key

this projeect only contain above requirenments only hence it is not a authentication system it is just a simple user registration system

thank you, have a nice day
